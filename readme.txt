The author is Micheal Curley.

The objective of this years assignment to build a Windows Universal Platform application which posed many challenges. I spent a large portion of my time trying out different ideas. I'm fairly satisfied with my attempt but there was limitations to my idea.
Even though it's an extensive converter I feel I should have picked another application to implement.
